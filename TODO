TODO

* Find out how Jasmine generates debug output and override whatever's necessary to display vectors as (x, y).
* Several places in the code use two variables xVar and yVar instead of a single vector. This should be changed.
* Write mock canvas that saves calls and can be queried as to where images have been drawn.
* Create ComponentProcessor.withParameter (singular), which does the same as withParameters.
* ComponentProcessor.using should also accept a Function object and call it directly.
